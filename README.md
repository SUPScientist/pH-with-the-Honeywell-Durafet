# Code from _Best practices for autonomous measurement of seawater pH with the Honeywell Durafet_
The open access paper, _Best practices for autonomous measurement of seawater pH with the Honeywell Durafet_ (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mio.2014.08.003), contains an Appendix with supplementary material, including several critical MATLAB scripts. These scripts are sometimes challenging to find due to their being buried in a .docx file with an undescriptive caption which I am unable to change. In order to facilitate access to the same code, I am placing it in this repository. Please cite the aforementioned paper if you use this code or a derivative thereof.
